# website_tutorial

Creating and hosting your own website can often be intimidating and inaccessible due to paywalls or inexperience with coding. This workshop will cover using Hugo to generate professional-looking HTML content from easy-to-write yaml files and using GitHub + Google Domains to host your website content for $0-12 per year! 

Students should come with their own laptop pre-installed with git. No prior knowledge required, but a basic understanding of Git will help.
