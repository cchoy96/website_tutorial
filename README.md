# website_tutorial

Creating and hosting your own website can often be intimidating and inaccessible due to paywalls or inexperience with coding.

Sites like SquareSpace will charge you $144/year and sites like GoDaddy will charge you $72/year with pricey add-ons that should really just come with owning the website. Additionally, many of the features they do provide are functionally useless for those aiming to host something simple like a static portfolio website. For many, the only allure they offer is the professional look they can provide those with no knowledge of HTML.

For those willing to invest an extra hour of their time, there IS an easier and cheaper way that will give them full control over their website and its contents.

This workshop will cover using Hugo to generate professional-looking HTML content from easy-to-write yaml files and using GitHub + Google Domains to host your website content for only $0-12 per year!

Students should come with their own laptop pre-installed with git. No prior knowledge required, but a basic understanding of Git will help.

DISCLAIMER: there are many, many, many ways to go about creating and hosting your own website outside of the ones mentioned here. What will be taught here is just what I've personally found to work well.
