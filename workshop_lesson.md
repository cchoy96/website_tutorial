# Create and Host your own Website
Creating and hosting your own website can often be intimidating and inaccessible due to paywalls or inexperience with coding. This workshop will cover using Hugo to generate professional-looking HTML content from easy-to-write yaml files and using GitHub + Google Domains to host your website content for $0-12 per year! 

Students should come with their own laptop pre-installed with git. No prior knowledge required, but a basic understanding of Git will help.
